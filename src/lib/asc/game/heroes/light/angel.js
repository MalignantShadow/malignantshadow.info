        Upon reaching Level 3 when you choose to study this Hero, you can use your bonus action to release the Aura within yourself and
        inspire those around you. For the next minute, or until you end the effect as a bonus action, your figure emits a slight glow
        (5 feet of dim light) and white, translucent, feathered wings spread from your shoulders.

        All allies within 40 feet of you are immediately inspired if they were not already. These same allies remain inspired as
        long as you are within their line of sight, even after using an Inspiration die. However, they may only use 1 Inspiration die during
        their turn and cannot use more than 2 Inspiration dice for the duration of this feature. At the end of this featureâ€™s duration,
        they are no longer Inspired.
